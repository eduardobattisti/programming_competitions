Programming competitions are Mathematical problems that must be solved
using programming. Some considerations are used to evaluate your solution.
The time that your program needs to run and solve the problem. The amount
of memory that the program needs to solve the problem. When you post the 
solution. The competitions always have determined time and a number of 
problems. You must solve the problems at that time.

These are some problems from programming competitions and solutions that 
I found. The solutions, for a while, are only in Python, soon I would like 
to solve the problems in C++. 

Every problem has the question and solution. Sometimes the solution,
which I found isn't the best, but how it's working I consider it. If you
find a better solution to the problem and would like to share, or even 
challenge yourself be free to try and tell me how was your solution. 
Share knowledge in programming is always great.

Every solution posted will have some explanation. How is the problem,
how the solution was implemented, and how the code works.

All the problems are from https://codeforces.com/. If you want to look 
for more challenges, feel free to find it in the site. If you have any 
doubt about it, question me, I will try to help you. Just considering 
I'm new in this programming competition, but I can help with I know.
